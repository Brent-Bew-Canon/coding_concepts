    <h1>Review of Concepts from ASU Bootcamp</h1>
    <p>Use this guide for a refresher on all the major concepts we cover in the course. Feel free to contribute to this
        open-source project!</p>

    <h2>jQuery</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>A JavaScript library that is a great help with DOM traversal</li>
        <li> Faster than vanilla JS</li>
        <li> Is being phased out in preference for other frameworks like React</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Node.js</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Allows you to write server-side code using JavaScript.</li>
        <li>Cross-platform, open-source server environment </li>
        <li>Back-end JavaScript runtime environment running on the V8 JavaScript Engine</li>
        <li>Allows you to write command line tools for server-side scripting.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>JSON</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Stands for JavaScript Object Notation</li>
        <li>It is a lightweight format for stroing and transporting data</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>NPM</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Worldâ€™s largest software registry used to share and borrow packages</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>package.json</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Lists packages your project depends on</li>
        <li>Specifies versions of a package that your project can use</li>
        <li>Makes your build reproducible and easier to share with other developers</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Asynchronous JavaScript</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Technique that enables your program to start a potentially long-running task and still be able to be
            responsive to other events while that task runs. (Rather than having to wait for that task to finish first)
        </li>
        <li>Once that task is finished, your program is presented with the result</li>
        <li>The opposite is synchronous, which basically means that your program runs one thing at a time. If it takes
            30 minutes to complete the first task, the program will be unable to respond or address anything else until
            after that task is completed</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Object Oriented Programming (OOP)</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Computer programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and
            logic</li>
        <li>OOP focuses on the objects that developers want to manipulate rather than the logic required to manipulate
            them</li>
        <li>Examples of an object can range from physical entities, such as a human being who is described by properties
            like name and address, to small computer programs, such as widgets</li>
        <li>Once an object is known, it is labeled with a class of objects that defines the kind of data it contains and
            any logic sequences that can manipulate it</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Test Driven Development (TDD)</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Software development process relying on software requirements being converted to test cases before software
            is fully developed</li>
        <li>Tracks all software development by repeatedly testing the software against all test cases</li>
        <li>This is as opposed to software being developed first and test cases created later</li>
        <li>Process:
            <ul>
                <li>Add a test</li>
                <li>Run all test with expectation that the new one fails</li>
                <li>Write the simplest code to pass the new test</li>
                <li>Run all tests again, all should pass</li>
                <li>Refactor as needed</li>
                <li>Repeat process</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Jest</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>A JavaScript testing framework</li>
        <li>Tests units of code to determine whether they are fit for use</li>
    </ul>
